Hi, this is my term project, PyScan Pro! This application serves as a learning and debugging
tool for students, integrating a code editor, a file explorer, and step-by-step tracing for a 
comprehensive learning experience.


To run this code, first run the following command in your terminal:
pip3 install opencv-python pillow pytesseract

Then run main.py, which is the entry point of the app
